# Setting up server after action is installed and started:
#
#     Install homebrew
#     brew install pyenv
#     pyenv install {python version, e.g. 3.8.9}
#     Follow directions at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository
#     sudo usermod -a -G docker {your username}
#     exit from ssh session and log back in
#     type `groups` to make sure you are in the docker group
#     sudo ./svc.sh stop
#     sudo ./svc.sh start
#
#     In Pipenv file, make sure Python version is '*' instead of a specific version, otherwise
#          the self-hosted action will fail to find a specific version. Just use whatever version
#          it thinks is on the droplet


# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Digital Ocean Build and Deploy

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: self-hosted

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
